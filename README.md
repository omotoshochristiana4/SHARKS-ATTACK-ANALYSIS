# 🦈 Sharks Attack Data Analysis

## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes **global shark attack data** to uncover trends and patterns that can guide **safety awareness, tourism, and marine research**.  
The dataset contains records of shark attacks since 1900, including details on **location, time, species, activity, and outcomes**.

---

## 🔎 Key Findings
- **Annual Trend:** Shark attacks have steadily increased over time, with more cases reported after 1950.  
- **High-Risk Countries:** USA, Australia, and South Africa account for the majority of cases.  
- **Injury Patterns:** Legs and arms are the most commonly injured body parts.  
- **Time of Day:** Most attacks occur in the **afternoon** and **evening hours**.  
- **Species Involved:** Great White Shark, Tiger Shark, and Bull Shark are the most frequently responsible species.
